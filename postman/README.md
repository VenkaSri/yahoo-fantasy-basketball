# Postman Data
- This directory contains requests and environments for API calls made to the [Yahoo Fantasy Sports API](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/).
- Import the files in this directory into Postman. If you need help doing this, follow the guide [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/).
- Replace the values in the environment variables with values from your [Yahoo Developer app](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/). You will also need to replace the values in the collection variables.
